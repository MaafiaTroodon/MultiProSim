# MultiProSim
SimuOS is a process scheduling simulator written in C. It models how an operating system manages multiple processes using algorithms such as Round Robin, Priority-based, and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling. The simulator outputs detailed per-tick state transitions and per-process statistics, giving insight into real-time CPU scheduling behavior
